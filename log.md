# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: 1/5/17

**Today's Progress**: Catching up to jQuery now.

**Thoughts:** Still in familiar ground. Tomorrow will start with an actual project.  

### Day 1: 1/4/17

**Today's Progress**: Brushing up on front-end stuff on freeCodeCamp. End up spending 2 hours catching up half way through CSS.

**Thoughts:** It's nice to get back to the basic. I'll try to move on throught this. No link update after today until I've move on to different topics.
